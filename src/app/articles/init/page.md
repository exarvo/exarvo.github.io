title: Initializing the Blogging Site
author: K A R S H

This is an introductory article on what this place is about. An initialization to set the stage.

## What can you expect?

Truly speaking, expect nothing. That's the secret for living a happy life.

Although you can definitely expect me to dump information here from various corners of the internet. This space will definitely be more on Tech. But I am a firm believer of historicism you see, expect me to ramble a bit on the history of a certain tech and how it came to be.

Let me set it clear, internet isn't eternal. Some of the often-cited articles or sites are no more available. Most of them purposely erased, some forgotten through the cracks of time and information. Having said that, some of the articles, blogs or websites I refer might have disappeared. If I am lucky, there would be an archive of the articles, I will link them. I will definitely strive to make you all lucky.

## Bruh, what type of technology?

My interests as of 2025 are: Go Lang, TypeScript, C Lang, PostgreSQL, Git (Not GitHub), Docker, Linux, Terraform, Kubernetes. I have done a bit of React and front-end dev as-well-as PowerShell scripting, but not a big fan!

Let me also tell you, my interests go from Cloud Tech, Micro-controllers/PCB tech, Concurrent Programming (not parallelism), Compilers, Logics & Formal verification, Machine Learning, API development, TUI Command-Line tooling development, and so on.

This is just a humble place to dump what I know. And I haven't touched 10% of what is out there. I can be wrong too, just let me know. Remember to stay hungry and stay foolish! But let me be clear, Git is not GitHub, don't be an absolute fool.

LaTeX is fun. But a simple markdown is a blessing. That's why you are reading this article here, in this website.

There are a lot of To-Dos in Tech world, mine is a bit small but worth betting on:

- Go Lang
- Containerization
- Linux
- Git
- TinyML
- TensorFlow
- Kubernetes

Most of the above are core tech, and that's how you should start into tech. More on this only on: [exarvo](https://exarvo.github.io)
